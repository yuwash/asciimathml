========================

Node.js-based
[Pandoc filters](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/wiki/Pandoc-Filters)
for converting asciimathml into TeX

This is a fork of the
[asciimathml](https://github.com/asciimath/asciimathml) repository
providing the conversion scripts (originally for web browsers):

* ASCIIMathML.js is a compact JavaScript program that translates
  simple calculator-style math expressions on a webpage to MathML.
* asciimath-based/ASCIIMathTeXImg.js provides utility functions
  AMTparseAMtoTeX, AMparseMath, and AMprocessNode to convert
  expressions in AsciiMath notation into LaTeX expressions.
